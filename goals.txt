basic goals

- take text input

- build a map of the text

- answer queries about the text

A simple example

input: 
"Mary had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow."

map:

{
	"name":"Mary",
	"type":"person"
	"has":[
		{
			"type":lamb",
			"size":"little",
			"has":[
				{
					"type":"fleece",
					"color":"white"//(white as snow?)
				}
		}
	]
	
}

query:
	"what color is Mary's Lamb?"
answer:
	"white"



future goals / issues / notes

- verifying information
- resolving discrepencies between maps
- create a permanent knowledge base/experiences help to parse new info
- accept image and audio inputs, connect images to text
- ask moderators questions about the text to clarify
- make assumptions, for example assume that the lamb is white, since the fleece is white
- multiple states/ tentative information for ambiguous statements, for example, does Mary or the lamb have a white fleece
- create instruction sets, for example read a technical article, and return a list of instructions
- parse twitter feeds/facebook posts/political articles

- create different documents for different sources, and commit verified data to main knowledge base
